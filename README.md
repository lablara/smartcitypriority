# smartcitypriority
Python3 implementation of temperature sensor nodes (tempsensor) and a central controller (CPM), performing prioritization

This implementation is a proof-of-concept of the definitions presented in the article "A Prioritization Approach for Optimization of Multiple Concurrent Sensing Applications in Smart Cities"

The sensor node is executed through the file "tempsensor.py". It requires two additional libraries, which can be installed through the following commands:

pip3 install Adafruit_DHT
pip3 install wiringpi

The CPM is executed through the file "cpm.py"
